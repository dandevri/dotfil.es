Thin wrapper around node's native fs methods.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save write\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar writeFile = require('write');\n```\n\n## API\n\n### [writeFile](index.js#L40)\n\nAsynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists and creating any intermediate directories if they don't already exist. Data can be a string or a buffer. Returns a promise if a callback function is not passed.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `filepath` **{string|Buffer|integer}**: filepath or file descriptor.\n* `data` **{string|Buffer|Uint8Array}**: String to write to disk.\n* `options` **{object}**: Options to pass to [fs.writeFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) and/or [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp)\n* `callback` **{Function}**: (optional) If no callback is provided, a promise is returned.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar writeFile = require('write');\nwriteFile('foo.txt', 'This is content...', function(err) {\n  if (err) console.log(err);\n});\n\n// promise\nwriteFile('foo.txt', 'This is content...')\n  .then(function() {\n    // do stuff\n  });\n```\n\n### [.promise](index.js#L82)\n\nThe promise version of [writeFile](#writefile). Returns a promise.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `filepath` **{string|Buffer|integer}**: filepath or file descriptor.\n* `val` **{string|Buffer|Uint8Array}**: String or buffer to write to disk.\n* `options` **{object}**: Options to pass to [fs.writeFile](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) and/or [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp)\n* `returns` **{Promise}**\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar writeFile = require('write');\nwriteFile.promise('foo.txt', 'This is content...')\n  .then(function() {\n    // do stuff\n  });\n```\n\n### [.sync](index.js#L120)\n\nThe synchronous version of [writeFile](#writefile). Returns undefined.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `filepath` **{string|Buffer|integer}**: filepath or file descriptor.\n* `data` **{string|Buffer|Uint8Array}**: String or buffer to write to disk.\n* `options` **{object}**: Options to pass to [fs.writeFileSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefilesync_file_data_options) and/or [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp)\n* `returns` **{undefined}**\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar writeFile = require('write');\nwriteFile.sync('foo.txt', 'This is content...');\n```\n\n### [.stream](index.js#L151)\n\nUses `fs.createWriteStream` to write data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists and creating any intermediate directories if they don't already exist. Data can be a string or a buffer. Returns a new [WriteStream](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream) object.\n\n**Params**\n\n* `filepath` **{string|Buffer|integer}**: filepath or file descriptor.\n* `options` **{object}**: Options to pass to [mkdirp](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp) and [fs.createWriteStream](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_createwritestream_path_options)\n* `returns` **{Stream}**: Returns a new [WriteStream](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_writestream) object. (See [Writable Stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)).\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar writeFile = require('write');\nfs.createReadStream('README.md')\n  .pipe(writeFile.stream('a/b/c/other-file.md'))\n  .on('close', function() {\n    // do stuff\n  });\n```\n\n## Release history\n\n### v1.0.2 - 2017-07-11\n\n* improved documentation\n\n### v1.0.0 - 2017-07-09\n\n**Added**\n\n* [promise support](#promise)\n\n**Changed**\n\n* The main export will now return a promise if no callback is passed\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\n* [delete](https://www.npmjs.com/package/delete): Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async). | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/delete \"Delete files and folders and any intermediate directories if they exist (sync and async).\")\n* [read-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-data): Read JSON or YAML files. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/read-data \"Read JSON or YAML files.\")\n* [read-yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/read-yaml): Very thin wrapper around js-yaml for directly reading in YAML files. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/read-yaml \"Very thin wrapper around js-yaml for directly reading in YAML files.\")\n* [write-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/write-data): Write a YAML or JSON file to disk.
