Make sure you're using Atom `1.19`, currently in [Beta](https://atom.io/beta).\n2. Make sure you use either `One Dark UI` or `One Light UI`. Other themes might work too, see next question.\n\n#### Does it work for other Atom themes too?\n\nPossibly. But only the One themes are maintained.\n\nIf there are parts that are not translucent, you can override it in your [styles.less](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/#style-tweaks) file. Find the right selector in the [DevTools](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/creating-a-theme/#developer-tools), then make the background `transparent`. For example:\n\n```less\n.one-vibrancy {\n  // <- Add selectors here\n  atom-pane,\n  atom-panel,\n  .tree-view {\n    background-color: transparent !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### The font doesn't look sharp!\n\nYes, sub-pixel aliasing is lost when using a transparent background. A small price for a cool effect in return. ðŸ˜‰\n\n\n#### Is performance ok?\n\nHard to say. Haven't noticed major slowdowns, but an opaque background is probably still better for performance.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/simurai/one-vibrancy/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/simurai/one-vibrancy#readme","_id":"one-vibrancy@0.1.2","_shasum":"64b13908f652c7e01da45ddb5616fa52d4eb280d","_resolved":"file:../d-11763-8249-1chx7qf.ww3gfd2t9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11763-8249-1chx7qf.ww3gfd2t9/package.tgz"}
