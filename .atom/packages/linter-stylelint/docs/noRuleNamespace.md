# No Namespace Rules

Unfortunately the rule you have clicked on comes from a plugin, but that
plugin used the generic namespace of `plugin` instead of creating their own.
This means that it is impossible to determine a URL to link to the definition
of the rule.

You can try filing an issue on the repository of the rule if you know where it
came from asking them to use a namespace. If that happens then the new
namespace can be added to the list of known plugins by following the
instructions [here][linkingnewrule].
